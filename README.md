Flow test for prototypical discussion system for Wikimedia


Ideas & Notes
=======
For this project I implemented jQuery primarily, but also had to test out the AJAX via a PHP pipe. Due to the Single Origin Policy I got a 200 response from discussion.json but the browser wouldn't go through with the GET request. 

Threaded discussions should "flow" just like the title of your prototype says. Discussions happen fluidly, so a fluid design is what I would go for to facilitate that. As an example of this, I have the Reply button pop up on hover so that as users are scrolling through they naturally see the Reply button.
